<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About Aniloader

As a frequent Anime-watcher and Series-Collector, who wants to stay up to Date with the newest releases in an hourly fashion,
I had to find a solution to the constant *"Downloading all Episodes released that day in the evening".* So I automated it. 
I really hope that this Programm can lighten your day, even if just by a bit.

Here's why:
* Your time to browse the **NEW** Anime of the day and downloading every single Episodes manually can be used for much more important activities. Like watching more Anime!
* You shouldn't have to organizing your entire library manually just so Daddy-Plex is happy. It's a hassel. Let Aniloader take care of it for you.
* You should just be able to enjoy the latest Anime right when it comes out. Let Aniloader do the delivery :mailbox_with_mail:

Of course, this is only one of the possible functions. So you can expect me to be adding more features in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

### Built With

* [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/)
* [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

Though not a necesity, I very much recommend the media-Player due to its versitillity.

This Application uses the **qBittorrent Web UI** to manage the Magnet-Links found on SubsPlease. After installing it from the [official site](https://www.qbittorrent.org/), 
make sure that the *options->Web UI* match this Picture:</br></br>

**IP address:** Type your IPv4-address. You can find it by typing *ipconfig* in your console</br>
