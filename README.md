<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About Aniloader

As a frequent Anime-watcher and Series-Collector, who wants to stay up to Date with the newest releases in an hourly fashion,
I had to find a solution to the constant *"Downloading all Episodes released that day in the evening".* So I automated it. 
I really hope that this Programm can lighten your day, even if just by a bit.

Here's why:
* Your time to browse the **NEW** Anime of the day and downloading every single Episodes manually can be used for much more important activities. Like watching more Anime!
* You shouldn't have to organizing your entire library manually just so Daddy-Plex is happy. It's a hassel. Let Aniloader take care of it for you.
* You should just be able to enjoy the latest Anime right when it comes out. Let Aniloader do the delivery :mailbox_with_mail:

Of course, this is only one of the possible functions. So you can expect me to be adding more features in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

### Built With

* [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/)
* [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/)
* [SubsPlease](https://subsplease.org/)
* [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

* Plex</br>
Though not a necesity, I very much recommend the media-Player due to its versitillity.
[Official Site](https://www.plex.tv/)

* qBittorrent</br>
This Application uses the **qBittorrent Web UI** to manage the Magnet-Links found on SubsPlease. After installing it from the [official site](https://www.qbittorrent.org/), 
make sure that the *options->Web UI* match this Picture:</br></br>
<img src="images/qbit.png" alt="qBit" width="600"></br></br>
**IP address:** Type your IPv4-address. You can find it by typing *ipconfig* in your console</br>
**Port:** Make sure this number matches with the *torrent_port* you defined in Aniloaders `config.py`</br>
**Authentication:** Define a username and password</br>

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Xanahol/Aniloader.git
   ```
3. Install requirements
   ```sh
   pip install -r .\requirements.txt
   ```
4. Enter your settings in `config.py`
   ```python
   #Example
   ip_4 = "192.168.4.162" 
   torrent_port = "8080"
   directories = ['C:\Example\Plex\Anime', 'D:\Example\Path\To\Plex\Anime']
   ```



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Here is how you can run the different modes and what they do:

### Update Seasonal
 #### Update your library with the freshest Anime of the day!</br></br>
  To run, type:</br>

  ```console
  python.exe .\main.py -m updateSeasonal  
  ```
  </br>
  Aniloader connects to SubsPlease and the qBittorrent Web-UI.</br>

  ```console
    Feb-28-2021 18:55:38 - INFO - Connecting to Subsplease
    Feb-28-2021 18:55:38 - INFO - Connecting to the qBittorrent
    Feb-28-2021 18:55:38 - INFO - Your IP is: 192.168.1.135
    ...
  ```
  </br>

  Aniloader starts up by asking for your qBittorrent-credentials. Type them into the console and hit **Enter**.</br>

  ```console
    Please enter your credentials for qBittorrent:
    Username:Xana
    Password:MyVerySafePassword123
    Feb-28-2021 18:55:38 - INFO - Login successful!
  ```
  </br>

  It then proceeds collecting the links of every Anime with the NEW-Tag:</br>

  ```console
    Feb-28-2021 18:55:38 - INFO - Found 14 Anime with the tag "New!"
    Feb-28-2021 18:55:38 - INFO - Collecting links for Non Non Biyori Nonstop | Season 1
    Feb-28-2021 18:55:38 - INFO - Collected 8 links
    Feb-28-2021 18:55:38 - INFO - Collecting links for Idoly Pride | Season 1
    Feb-28-2021 18:55:38 - INFO - Collected 8 links 
    ...
  ```
  </br>

  After the Links have been collected, they are submitted to qBittorrent.</br>
  If the anime/season folder doesen't exist, Aniloader adds it (first defined dir in `config.py`). If one does, it uses the one already definded.</br>

  ```console
    Feb-28-2021 18:55:38 - INFO - Starting Download-Process...

    Feb-28-2021 18:55:38 - INFO - The anime Non Non Biyori Nonstop has 8 episodes so far
    Feb-28-2021 18:55:38 - INFO - Downloading them to C:\Example\Plex\Anime\Non Non Biyori Nonstop\Season 01
    Feb-28-2021 18:55:38 - INFO - 1 of which are not on the server yet
    Feb-28-2021 18:55:38 - INFO - Inserting Links to download
    Feb-28-2021 18:55:38 - INFO - Inserting Download Path
    Feb-28-2021 18:55:38 - INFO - Submitting Links
    Feb-28-2021 18:55:38 - INFO - Process finished for Non Non Biyori Nonstop

    Feb-28-2021 18:55:38 - INFO - The anime Idoly Pride has 8 episodes so far
    Feb-28-2021 18:55:38 - INFO - Downloading them to C:\Example\Plex\Anime\Season 01
    Feb-28-2021 18:55:38 - INFO - 1 of which are not on the server yet
    Feb-28-2021 18:55:38 - INFO - Inserting Links to download
    Feb-28-2021 18:55:38 - INFO - Inserting Download Path
    Feb-28-2021 18:55:38 - INFO - Submitting Links
    Feb-28-2021 18:55:38 - INFO - Process finished for Idoly Pride
    ...
  ```
  </br>

  At this point you can monitor what is being put in your download-queue and you can delete whatever you don't need.</br></br>


 ### Standardize
 #### Standardize your library for Plex!</br></br>
  To run, type:</br>

  ```console
  python.exe .\main.py -m standard
  ```

   Aniloader will go through your library and standardize them for Plex:</br>

  ```console
    Feb-28-2021 19:30:46 - INFO - Renaming Hataraku Saibou Black Season 1
    Feb-28-2021 19:30:46 - INFO - Renaming successful
